### Future-proofing
The list of tools and services available for building your solution is continually expanding. Capabilities you had to custom-build last year can now be bought as a service or added for no cost. We can help you find the latest technologies that are stable enough to suit your project.

### BUY versus BUILD
A typical developer will be inclined to code his way out of a problem. However, a purchased solution has to yield benefits quickly to make it worth the cost. The choice depends on factors from team composition to the goals and resources of the project. We can provide perspective about these experiences from experience in the trenches.

### Monolithic = Neolithic?
Architectures for breaking up monolithic systems are gaining more interest each year. But adoption has its own immediate costs. Eagerly adopting the latest architecture used by Amazon development can divert the team from business problems for an indeterminate amount of time. We can help establish guidelines that will allow the team to navigate between dead-end expediency and over-engineering.

### Legacy software decisions
Decisions about legacy systems reflect the mindset of the decision-makers. An innovator might choose to scrap last year's app. A conservative manager will keep it running to support the last ten users still on it. With a seasoned approach to legacy code, there can be more options than merely 'scrap' or 'sustain'. We can help you ask the right questions to find a tenable path forward.

### First Decisions
Time and resources are limited. Don't spend them learning things you could know now. Use our experience to play with and test your assumptions before the project begins. We understand how unchallenged assumptions can sap the momentum and viability of a project. Let us put your ideas to the test.

### Cloudy with a chance of Requirements
Lack of clarity in the requirements is only magnified in implementation. Requirements reflect the clarity of the product concept. You may not hear from implementers if requirements are vague - they will do their best, and you will not get what you envisioned. We can reveal inconsistencies in your requirements and help you trace it back to your product concept.

### Focusing dev attention
Developers are interested in challenging problems, architectural elegance, and technical ingenuity. Often these motivations align with your own product goals. But do you know how to recognize and respond when they don't? We understand developers, and can help you state your goals in terms they understand.

### Concept maturity
Don't stake your project on the first iteration of your ideas. Maturing your product concept is an iterative process by necessity, because you learn as it develops. We excel in helping leaders and creators see what they have missed. Challenging assumptions and pursuing 

### Design by discovery
Starting implementation too early is expensive. Concept development is a process that is never finished. As you refine your product, your own knowledge is expanding. How do you know when your ideas are ready to be tested with code and when they aren't? In testing your ideas by discussion, we can help you better find out what you are <i>really</i> trying to build.

### API design
Designing a modern public-facing API involves a unique knowledge set. The field is still maturing, so there is a lot of outdated and contradictory information out there. We can introduce the basic conventions that are agreed as standard. We can help your team build a consistent API starting with clear understanding of your own domain.

### Test automation?
Everyone agrees that it is useful, but everybody disagrees about how much is needed. We can introduce you to tools and services to fit your team, and help you establish test automation goals connected to the goals of the overall project.

### Continuous delivery
No matter what you're building, you're going to have more than one release. Without a repeatable way to deploy your software, each successful release is a bit of blind luck. Continuous Delivery is a set of practices that takes that idea further to accelerate the development cycle.

### Innovation = Experimentation
If you are building something new, you won't get it quite right the first time. Anticipate re-inventing your product as you learn more. Plan your project with the knowledge that you will need the time and resources to try again. We can help you overcome roadblocks to getting a minimal product in front of users to test your expectations of the market.

### Thinking > Coding
If your thinking about the problem is not clear, coding will not improve the situation.
