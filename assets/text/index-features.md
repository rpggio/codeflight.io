### Analysis Paralysis
Engineers like to solve problems &ndash; that is their role. But it is not always apparent which problems must be solved for a project, and in what order. To avoid becoming hung up on design questions, it is important to doggedly focus on the next objective. <b>We can help you break through analysis paralysis by crystallizing the objective and paring down the scope of design.</b>

### Buy versus Build
Many developers are inclined to code their way out of a problem, so will not recommend a purchased solution. But a purchased solution has to yield benefits quickly to make it worth the cost. The choice depends on factors from team composition to the goals and resources of the project. <b>We can provide perspective about these choices based on our experience and your priorities.</b>

### Architecture Distraction
Architectural decisions are important for long-term viability as an application grows. But in early stages architecture concerns can often be a distraction from the goals of the project. If you have seen a project self-destruct due to architecture distraction, you can appreciate the danger. <b>We can demonstrate the practice of 'barely enough' architecture to avoid the pitfalls of over-engineering.</b>

### First Decisions
Time and resources are limited. Don't spend them learning things you could know now. A little well-timed advice could save a lot of effort. <b>We can point out direct paths and shorten your bootstrap phase, so you can spend your resources on delivering the product.</b> 

### Too Smart to Fail
What you don't know can hurt you, if you are unprepared to respond well. We know how unchallenged assumptions can sap the momentum and viability of a project. <b>Use our experience to check your assumptions about your product and implementation.</b> We will walk through your project plan together and identify lurking pitfalls.

### Concept maturity
Don't stake your project on the first iteration of your ideas. Maturing your product concept is an iterative process that requires testing of the embedded expectations.  We can help you take your concept through its paces, to see if it is ready. <b>This will often reveal new connections and possibilities that can completely change the design of the application.</b>

### Design by Discovery
Starting implementation too early is expensive. Concept development is a process that is never finished. As you refine your product, your own knowledge is expanding. How do you know when your ideas are ready to be tested with code and when they aren't? <b>In testing your ideas by discussion, we can help you better find out what you are <i>really</i> trying to build.</b>

### API design
Designing a modern public-facing API involves a unique knowledge set. Since the field is still developing, much of the information is outdated or contradictory. We can introduce to your team the fundamental conventions that are considered standard. <b>We can help your team build a consistent API starting with a clear understanding of your own domain.</b>

### Pragmatic test automation
Everyone agrees that it is useful, but everybody seems to disagree about how much is needed. The decision comes down to the scope and objectives of the project. <b>We can introduce you to some appropriate tools for testing, and help establish test automation goals that reflect the project goals.</b>

### Continuous Delivery
No matter what you're building, you're going to have more than one release. Without a repeatable way to deploy your software, each successful release is a bit of blind luck. Continuous Delivery is a set of practices that takes that idea even further to continually reduce the risk and time of delivering a release. The focus expands from building an application to building a process that delivers successive iterations of an application. <b>We can present the principles of Continuous Delivery and apply them pragmatically to your project.</b>

### Build just enough
If you are building something new, you won't get it quite right the first time. Anticipate re-inventing your product as you learn more. Plan your project with the knowledge that you will need the time and resources to try again. This means finding the Minimally Viable Product. <b>We can help you apply this principle to planning and impress it upon your development team.</b>

### Experiment to innovate
Customers determine the worth of a product. New product development often suffers from the assumption that the current solution is at or close to the best solution. This leads project owners to focus on polishing the product before its basic design is proven correct. <b>We can help challenge your assumptions of correctness and focus on getting your product in front of customers in experimental form.</b>
