### Leading-edge, not Bleeding-edge
The list of tools and services available for building your solution is continually expanding. Capabilities you had to custom-build last year can now be bought as a service or taken from open source. But these sources come with their own risks and learning curve which may make them unsuitable for your project. <b>We can help you find modern, stable technologies with risk/reward to make them worth your time.</b>

### Analysis paralysis
Engineers like to solve problems &ndash; that is their role. But it is not always apparent which problems must be solved for a project, and in what order. To avoid becoming hung up on design questions, it is important to doggedly focus on the next objective. <b>We can help teams break through analysis paralysis by clearly identifying the objective and limiting the scope of design.</b>

### Buy versus Build
Most developers are inclined to code their way out of a problem, so will not recommend a purchased solution. But a purchased solution has to yield benefits quickly to make it worth the cost. The choice depends on factors from team composition to the goals and resources of the project. <b>We can provide perspective about these choices based on our experience and your priorities.</b>

### Architecture distraction
Architectural decisions are important for long-term viability as an application grows. But in early stages architecture concerns can often be a distraction from the goals of the project. If you have seen a project self-destruct due to architecture distraction, you can appreciate the danger. <b>We can help your team cultivate an ethic of 'barely enough' architecture to avoid the pitfalls of over-engineering.</b>

### Legacy software decisions
Decisions about legacy systems reflect the mindset of the decision-makers. An innovator might choose to scrap last year's app. A conservative manager will keep it running to support the last ten users still on it. With a seasoned approach to legacy code, there can be more options than merely 'scrap' or 'sustain'. <b>We can help you ask the right questions to find a tenable path forward.</b>

### First Decisions
Time and resources are limited. Don't spend them learning things you could know now. Use our years of experience to check your assumptions before the project begins. We understand how unchallenged assumptions can sap the momentum and viability of a project. <b>Let us put your ideas to the test.</b>

### Cloudy with a chance of Requirements
Lack of clarity in requirements is only magnified in implementation. The quality of requirements reflects the clarity of the product concept. You may not hear from your developers if requirements are vague &mdash; they will struggle through, and you will not get what you envisioned. <b>We can clear the air by exposing requirement inconsistencies, tracing them back to their root in product conceptualization.</b>

### Counting toothpicks
Developers are interested in challenging problems, architectural elegance, and technical ingenuity. These are all useful when they work in concert with the product goals. Do you know how to recognize when these motives are working at odds with the product, when developers have been caught in fascinating irrelevant problems? <b>We can help you keep the business goals in the driver's seat while keeping developers engaged.</b>

### Concept maturity
Don't stake your project on the first iteration of your ideas. Maturing your product concept is an iterative process that requires testing of the embedded expectations.  We can help you take your concept through its paces, to see if it is ready. <b>This will often reveal new connections and possibilities that can completely change the design of the application.</b>

### Design by discovery
Starting implementation too early is expensive. Concept development is a process that is never finished. As you refine your product, your own knowledge is expanding. How do you know when your ideas are ready to be tested with code and when they aren't? <b>In testing your ideas by discussion, we can help you better find out what you are <i>really</i> trying to build.</b>

### API design
Designing a modern public-facing API involves a unique knowledge set. Since the field is still developing, much of the information is outdated or contradictory. We can introduce to your team the fundamental conventions that are considered standard. <b>We can help your team build a consistent API starting with a clear understanding of your own domain.</b>

### Test automation consensus
Everyone agrees that it is useful, but everybody seems to disagree about how much is needed. The decision comes down to the scope and objectives of the project. <b>We can introduce you to some appropriate tools for testing, and help establish test automation goals that reflect the project goals.</b>

### Continuous delivery
No matter what you're building, you're going to have more than one release. Without a repeatable way to deploy your software, each successful release is a bit of blind luck. Continuous Delivery is a set of practices that takes that idea even further to continually reduce the risk and time of delivering a release. The focus expands from building an application to building a process that delivers successive iterations of an application. <b>We can help you understand the principles of Continuous Delivery and apply them pragmatically to your project.</b>

### Build just enough
If you are building something new, you won't get it quite right the first time. Anticipate re-inventing your product as you learn more. Plan your project with the knowledge that you will need the time and resources to try again. This means finding the Minimally Viable Product. <b>We can help you apply this principle to planning and impress it upon your development team.</b>

### Experiment to innovate
Customers determine the worth of a product. New product development often suffers from the assumption that the current solution is at or close to the best solution. This leads project owners to focus on polishing the product before its basic design is proven correct. <b>We can help challenge your assumptions of correctness and focus on getting your product in front of customers in experimental form.</b>
