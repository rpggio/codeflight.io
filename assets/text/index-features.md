### Technology acquisition
The list of tools and services available for building your solution is continually expanding. Capabilities you had to custom-build last year can now be bought as a service (or added for free). We can help you find the latest technologies that are stable enough to suit your project.

### Buy vs. build
A typical developer will be inclined to code his way out of a problem. That should be considered when weighing the buy versus build question. However, a purchased solution must yield benefits quickly to make it worthwhile. We can provide advice from the trenches about these decisions.

### Monolithic = Neolithic?
Techniques for breaking up monolithic systems gain more interest each year. However, eagerly adopting the latest architecture used by Amazon can divert the team from business problems for an unpredictable amount of time. We can help establish principles that will allow the team to walk the line between expediency and over-engineering.

### Legacy software costs and benefits
The treatment of legacy systems is determined by the mindset of the decision-makers. A bold innovator will scrap last year's app. A conservative manager will keep it running for the remaining ten users. With a seasoned approach to legacy code, there are more than just two options available. We can help you ask the right questions to find a tenable path forward.
### The first decisions are important
Time and resources are limited. Don't spend them learning things you could know now.
Challenge your assumptions while the cost of code changes is zero. The larger the code base is, the more prohibitive it is to change it. We understand how unchallenged assumptions can sap the momentum and viability of a project.
### Be clear with requirements
Lack of clarity in the concept phase is only magnified in implementation. Implementers will not always tell you if your requirements are lacking, because they don't recognize it or because it's not in their interest. You may not get what you envisioned. 
We can reveal inconsistencies in your requirements, and we won't hesitate to tell you.
### Channeling developer initiative
Developers are interested in challenging problems, architectural elegance, and technical ingenuity. Often these motivations align with your own product goals. But do you know how to recognize and respond when they don't?
### Concept maturity
Don't stake your project on the first iteration of your ideas. We excel in helping leaders and creators see what they have missed. Whether in the maturity of the concept, the suitability of the technology, or the reliability of the delivery process, we see your project through a unique lens.
### Design is a discovery process
Starting implementation too early is expensive. Concept development is a process that is never finished. As you refine your product, your own knowledge is expanding. How do you know when your ideas are ready to be tested with code and when they aren't?
### API design
Designing a modern public-facing API involves a unique knowledge set. The field is still maturing, so there is a lot of outdated and contradictory information out there. We can introduce the basic conventions that are agreed as standard. We can help your team build a consistent API starting with clear understanding of your own domain.
### Test automation?
Everyone agrees that it is useful, but everybody disagrees about how much is worthwhile. Because the field is still maturing, anecdotal arguments and dogmatism run rampant. We can help you get a handle on this bone of contention by exploring how you perceive your business.
