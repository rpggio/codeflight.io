        <h3><b>Your time and resources are limited.</b> Don't spend them learning things you could know now.</h3>

        <p>
        <b>Challenge your assumptions while the cost of code changes is zero.</b> The larger the code base is, the more prohibitive it is to change it. We understand how unchallenged assumptions can sap the momentum and viability of a project.
        </p>  

        <p>
        When ideas are implemented in code, they can become cemented. These create the risk of your project stalling out. Discover new ways to see your product when it's most effective and the least risk. We excel at asking questions that create opportunities.

        <h3><b>Design is a discovery process.</b> Starting implementation too early is expensive.</h3>

        <p> 
        Concept development is a process that is never finished. As you refine your product, your own knowledge is expanding. How do you know when your ideas are ready to be tested with code and when they aren't?
        </p>        

        <p>
        <b>The success of your project depends on how you respond to new information.</b> How can you tell if your expectations for the design are inflexible? Will you recognize when it's time to change direction? We can help you be ready for that moment.

        <p>
        <b>Don't let blind spots hold your project back.</b> We excel in helping leaders and creators see what they have missed. Whether in the maturity of the concept, the suitability of the technology, or the reliability of the delivery process, we see your project through a unique lens.
        </p>

        <p>
        We provide a sounding board to help you check your development plans before starting the project. You will talk to a senior developer with a breadth of development experience who can understand your goals.

        <h3><b>Be prepared</b> when you engage with developers and designers.</h3>

        <p>
        Lack of clarity in the concept phase is only magnified in implementation. Implementers will not always tell you if your requirements are lacking, because they don't recognize it or because it's not in their interest. You may not get what you envisioned.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Know what to expect from developers.</b> Developers are interested in challenging problems, architectural elegance, and technical ingenuity. Often these motivations align with your own product goals. But do you know how to recognize and respond when they don't?
